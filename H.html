		Storm surge is a coastal phenomenon that occurs during severe weather events, such as hurricanes, leading to a rise in sea level. It is caused by powerful winds and low atmospheric pressure, pushing water toward the coast. Storm surge poses significant risks, including coastal flooding, erosion, and infrastructure damage. Factors like storm intensity, size, coastal shape, and ocean floor topography determine the severity of the surge. To mitigate its impact, measures such as sea walls, levees, and accurate forecasting systems are employed. Understanding and preparing for storm surge are crucial for protecting coastal communities from the destructive effects of these events.
